# How to use:

1. Make sure 'map images' and 'raw map images' folders exist. If not, run the script once to create them.
2. Insert any images you wish to scale in 'raw map images' folder
3. Run 'run.bat' or .py file
4. scaled images are created in 'map images': they should be in **320x195** resolution.
	- for other resolutions, open image_scaler.py -> enter line 8 and change the numbers of scaled_res tuple

Then copy 'map images' or its contents to btd6bot/Files and you should have map images displayed in gui (main and queue windows)
