"""Commands for controlling round time flow.

Includes AutoStart class that tracks autostart status.

Functions:
__
    sleep: avoid further commands for specified time  
    begin: press start button twice (must be included in every plan as default is to have autostart on)  
    change_autostart: change current autostart setting, by default autostart is always on. Calling this function 
        reverts it, but can also change it back.  
    end_round: click start button once; either if autostart disabled OR if button need only be pressed once for fast 
    track (deflation)
