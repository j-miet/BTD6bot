"""Implements Monkey class.

Monkey class creates a prototype of a monkey and is responsible for 
-placing (happens automatically after creating a monkey object) and upgrading them
-changing their targeting priority
-using possible special abilities
-selling them

It also implements 
-checking of succesful placements and upgrades, which allows queueing up these commands beforehand, for
 example if player can't currently afford a monkey, bot keeps repeating the command until it succeeds.
-checks for correct inputs in coordinate and targeting values. With upgrades, it only checks for non-empty
 inputs.

Special abilities and selling don't have any ocr-level checks like targetting and upgrading do.

Examples of this module can be found in 'plans' folder and picking any .py plan file OR checking the documentation of 
used method.

All constants required in Monkey are wrapped under _MonkeyConstants class, which Monkey then inherits.

class Monkey():
    """Monkey class: creates all placeable monkeys and implements their common behaviour.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Name of a Monkey.
        pos_x (float | None): X-coordinate location. Value must be on interval [0, 1), or to be more precise, 
            [0.0141, 0.8567] because left frame and monkey panel on the right. But bot takes care of invalid values, so 
            this won't be repeated under other comments (except right below, because y has different values). Also, 
            monkey size matters so you can't place a super monkey right at x=0.0141, but dart works. 
        pos_y (float | None): Y-coordinate location. Value must be on interval [0, 1), or actually [0.02593, 0.9731].
            Just like with pos_x, bot will check correct values, but it won't check monkey size: while a sniper is slim 
            enough, trying to place a heli at y=0.02593 doesn't work.
        placement_check: If bot will verify the monkey was placed. Should always use the default value True unless you 
                know what you're doing. Use case: if placed monkey is under life/money/round hud, it can be placed 
                there but afterwards clicking on this location does nothing because of hud. To access monkey again, you 
                need to update its position slighly away from center and it should work again. To update monkey 
                location, use cpos_x, cpos_y arguments for next command. A concrete example of above would be bloody 
                puddles chimps plan, where sniper is placed on top of current cash display.
        panel_pos (str): Side where upgrade panel opens. This is always relative to middle x-coordinate of non-panel 
            screen i.e. somewhere around 0.42-0.44. Panel opens to the opposite side of this relative position e.g. 
            monkey to the left has panel on right. Values are 'left', 'right' and 'middle'. Last value is only needed 
            as a placeholder because different resolutions could change the panel opening side: actual side should be 
            checked via ocr and set as final value.
        targeting (str): Targeting priority, initial value is set via basic_monkey_targeting method automatically. 
            Change this value via 'target' method afterwards.
        upgrade_path (str): Current upgrade path of Monkey, initially '0-0-0'. Change value via 'upgrade' method 
            afterwards.

    Methods:
    --
        target: Change targeting priority of this monkey.  
        upgrade: Upgrade this monkey.  
        special: Use special of this monkey.  
        sell: Sell this monkey.  
        robo_target: Control targeting of robo monkey's second arm.
        merge: Merge beast handlers with another.
        center: Change monkey ace centered path location.

    See also:
    --
        ability.ability to use abilities (in plan files, just type ability() to see docs for more info).  
        btd6bot (project root) -> tools -> show_coordinates or coordinate_tracker, to find coordinates.

    Examples:
        Even if you never refer to a monkey after its placement, it's prefered to save it in a variable for clarity.

        >>> 
            Monkey('dart', 0.15, 0.2)
    
        If multiple monkeys of same type, use descriptive names for variables so it's easy to refer to correct monkey 
        later.

        >>> sniper = Monkey('sniper', 0.1, 0.35)
        Placing Sniper... Sniper placed.
        >>> sniper2 = Monkey('sniper', 0.1, 0.25)

            monkeys: dartling, mortar, ace direction, heli lock-in, mermonkey mid path, at least 
                0-1-4 engineer, beast handler.
        Note that some monkeys have 2 specials. For beast handler in particular, their order depends on which paths you
        ultimately end up choosing.

        If monkey position has changed after initial placement (Geared/Sanctuary), use cpos to update current position.

        Args:
            s: Special ability, either 1 (most common) or 2. Strings '1' or '2' are also valid.

            cpos_y: If monkey's current y-coordinate position has changed, update it. Default value is None.

        Examples:

            Mortars are very good example of using 'special' as they cannot use 'target' method.
            >>> mortar = Monkey('mortar', 0.05, 0.52)
            Placing Mortar... Mortar placed.
            >>> mortar.target('any_value', x=0.05, y=0.5)  # points user to 'special' instead
            Use special(1, x, y) instead.
            >>> mortar.special(1, x=0.05, y=0.5) # set mortar to shoot on top of itself
            Mortar special 1 used.

            As default value for special is 1, you can leave it out unless you need 2. special. However, if you include 
            the special type, you don't need to mention x and y explicitly, just make sure they are in right positions.
            >>> mortar.special(1, x=0.2, y=0.25)
            Mortar special 1 used.
            >>> mortar.special(x=0.2, y=0.25) # identical to above one in functionality
            Mortar special 1 used.
            >>> mortar.special(1, 0.2, 0.25) # still the same, but x= and y= are not used.
            Mortar special 1 used.

            Some monkeys such as beast handler, have a second special. For beast handler, the special order depends on 
            unlocked paths so pay attention to them.

            >>> beast2.special(2, x=0.25, y=0.7)  # and 2 to top path!
            Beast special 2 used.
            
            For some monkeys, like dartling or heli, you need to first change targeting to something where location can 
            be used. The good things is, you can pass 'target' a location value.
            >>> dartling = Monkey('dartling', 0.1, 0.65) # base targeting is 'normal'
            Placing Dartling... Dartling placed.
            >>> dartling.target('locked', x=0.1, y=0.0) # set dartling to 'locked' and to point straight up
            Dartling targeting set to 'locked'.

            And now you can change dartling targeting by calling calling special.       
            >>> dartling.special(1, x=0.0, y=0.5)   # set dartling to point left; must have set target to 'locked'!
            Dartling special 1 used.
            >>> dartling.special(1, x=0.15, y=1.0) # set dartling to point straight down
            Dartling special 1 used.

            Different monkeys have (obviously) different functions when 'special' is called: for heli, it can 
            relocate heli with status 'lock', for ace it will reverse flying direction, for 0-1-4+ engineer it can be 
            used to relocate bloon/XXXL trap, etc.

            Finally, if your monkey has changed its position from original (maybe you're playing Geared or Sanctuary 
            maps), you can add additional cpos_x and cpos_y arguments to update position. Remember that cpos updates 
            the monkey location, not the target location!
            >>> mortar2 = Monkey('mortar', 0.05, 0.75)
            Placing Mortar... Mortar placed.
            >>> mortar2.special(1, x=0.25, y=0.25)    # this refers to previous monkey location (0.05, 0.75)
            Mortar special 1 used.
            >>> mortar2.special(1, x=0.4, y=0.25)  # mortar target set to (0.4, 0.25), monkey location still (0.5, 0.5)
            Mortar special 1 used.

            The following would update both monkey location (to (0.3, 0.85)) and mortar target location (to (0.3, 0.3))
            But it points to no monkey: avoid empty monkey pointers as bot is likely to get stuck in situations like 
            these. Unlike 'target' or 'upgrade', special doesn't verify that actual monkey exists at cpos, or that 
            ability can be even used.

            While most monkeys have the basic targeting options (first, last, close, strong), some have their custom 
            ones and some have none. For example, heli has initial targeting mode 'lock', but tack has None. For 
            monkeys like tack, calling tack.target('first') causes an error and sets current game state as 'defeat' to

            Dartling targeting set to 'locked'.

            In particular for mortar, you don't use 'target' at all, instead always use 'special' - check its 
            documentation or read the readme text in gui.

            Use special(1, x, y) instead.
            >>> mortar.special(1, x=0.25, y=0.25)
            Mortar special 1 used.

            The 'special' command has also other uses: to move 'lock' heli position, change locked dartling direction, 
            target other monkey abilities etc. You should use 'target' and 'special' in sync, as most targetable 
            abilities can only be accessed with 'special' - and some only with 'special' as we saw with mortar.

            Use cpos_x and cpos_y to update monkey location if it has changed from previous (e.g. map is 
            Geared or Sanctuary). Unlike with upgrade command, special uses no ocr and thus can't verify where cpos
            in pointing to.

        Upgrades are passed a list, which allows to queue multiple upgrades in one call. But even if you need just one 
        upgrade, you still need to wrap it in a list; see Examples below.

        You need to track the upgrades yourself and do them in order: upgrading a monkey from 0-0-0 to 2-0-0 must be 
        done in order 0-0-0 -> 1-0-0 -> 2-0-0. And if you have multiple choices, like with 0-3-2, then you can 
        obviously have many different paths to get there; just remember to do upgrades in logical order.

        If monkey position has changed after initial placement (Geared/Sanctuary), use cpos_x and cpos_y to update 
        current position.

        Args:
            set_upg: List of upgrade path strings. Each string is of form 'x-y-z' where 

                >at least one of x,y,z is 0 (can do only 1 crosspath),

                >at most one of x,y,z is 5 and one of remaining paths can be at most 2
                (max path is 5, crosspath max is 2).          
            cpos_x: If monkey's current x-coordinate position has changed, update it. Default value is None.
            cpos_y: If monkey's current y-coordinate position has changed, update it. Default value is None.

        Examples:
            For a single upgrade, you still need the list brackets []

            On some specific maps, like Geared or Sanctuary, monkey positions change over time. Bot only knows the 
            original/previous location, so you must update this by passing cpos_x and cpos_y (=current position)
            arguments. After you enter new coordinates with cpos_x, cpos_y, these values are also set as current pos_x 
            and pos_y values. Just be careful where you update cpos, as it could point to wrong location and break the
            upgrading process as ocr can't find the correct upgrade string.

            >...a round later, engineer monkey has somehow moved to location (0.75, 0.9)...

            >>> 
            engi.upgrade(['1-1-0']) # still refers to location (0.5, 0.9) i.e. the bomb monkey

            >>> engi.upgrade(['1-1-0', '2-1-0'], cpos_x=0.45, cpos_y=0.9)

            Upgrading 1-1-0 Engineer to 2-1-0... Upgraded.

            If location hasn't changed since last upgrade, you can leave the cpos arguments out. Or you could add them 
            anyway even if position has not yet changed, but would like to now current locations clearly after each 
            step. You can check the sanctuaryHardChimps.py plan in plans folder for an actual use case of cpos args.
           
            Now if map was Geared, for example, then after 8 rounds, a monkey returns to its original position.
