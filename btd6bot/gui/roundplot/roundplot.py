"""Read the map's plan file located in 'plans' folder and creates a subplot out of all round commands.

This allows user to check what commands, on what round and in which order the plan includes.
Ignores lines containing # at any point and also lines having None/pass without anything else (i.e. placeholder lines).
So you can insert comments with #, just add them on separate rows - otherwise entire row is ignored.
Could implement lot of the stuff here using regular expressions but wasn't eager to spend time with them, honestly.


Issues (both old and current):

Plots get laggy very quickly if too much text is added, and become slow to move around. Haven't found a solution to
this as other backends don't fix anything. Good thing is current plots have a slider for round command scrolling which 
behaves much better even with the lag.

FIXED
There's also a mild memory leak problem that is tied to interractive plots: every time you open a plot, it reserves 
some memory for the rest of program runtime and is unable to be freed. So in theory, unless you open and close the plot 
window for like a hundred times, it will not be an issue. But it still annoying.  
>alas, there's an easy solution (which took way too long to implement): multiprocessing. Every time a plot is created, 
it's handled as a new process. When this process closes, it will automatically release all memory! This is because each 
process has its own memory space whereas threads share theirs among others. So in this case, matplotlib has 
issues with running two processes in one thread: handling both gui plot loops simultaneously (and it's not even the gui 
loop, just any program within same thread causes this issue). This results into problems with handling core functions, 
such as freeing any unused memory and thus is the root cause. But with multiprocessing, plotting is completely 
separated from bot program and thus can freely operate. And even if matplotlib had memory issues under new this 
process, it wouldn't matter because after a plot window closes, the process closes and will free any of its allocated 
memory nontheless.

FIXED
>This is for older solution, when the above solution with multiprocessing wasn't used:

To combat the memory issue, I decided to use matplotlib's garbage collector command+ close any open window 
objects: plt.clf() -> plt.close(). This did indeed slow the memory leak accumulation for a bit, so I kept those lines 
of code. For some time, I didn't notice anything as I rarely used plotting function before running the bot. And when 
I started to notice this error occuring, I suspected the problems were related to many other things, like
 -changing gui elements outside main thread (MainWindow.ocr_init),

 -importing modules that would be imported later in program (again, under MainWindow.ocr_init); found someone on 
 stackoverflow who descripted a similar problem and that was the cause,

 -some kind of thread interference between tkinter and matplotlib, as both should run individual threads and preferably 
 on main thread.

After enough time, I started investigating the last option more thoroughly, but for some time, didn't find any 
solution, until the one below. So the problem and solution is as follows:

Problem: after having used 'Show Plot' at least once and creating a new monitoring window resulted shortly after into a 
'RuntimeError: main thread is not in main loop'. 

Solution: It has something to do with this: https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/29198
So if you call matplotlib garbage collector and close the loop i.e. call the following methods and in that order:

    plt.clf()

    plt.close()

then it seems to interfere with tkinter's __del__ method under some part of code, causing
'Tcl_AsyncDelete: async handler deleted by the wrong thread' error on top. This causes current mainloop unable to 
detect itself inside main thread, because it appears tkinter terminates the current main thread, forcing a shutdown.
Now, I'm not quite sure why this did occur when creating a thread under Monitoringwindow.monitoring_window, but not 
under thread-creating methods for other windows.

So just removing those two lines that I added long time ago solved the issue entirely!

        #
        # x-axis has N rounds => it takes N-1 steps to traverse from first point to last if step length=1.

        # what is the shortest integer step length L that can reach from first point to last in up to K steps,
        # and L is an element of 'nums' (=all allowed step lengths, up to 10)
        #
        # >A mathematical formulation:
        # L>=1, K <= N-1
        # smallest value of L such that kL >= N with k<=K <=> L=N/n >= N/K. And as L is to be an integer, choose
        # ceil(N/K). Then find min{a in 'nums' : a >= ceil(N/K)}
        #
        # so if N=40, K=9, nums=[2,3,6,7] => ceil(N-1/K) = 5, but 5 not in nums, thus next smallest is 6.
        #
        # >What are all possible step lengths that land just at point N?
        # 1+kL = N => k = (N-1)/L
        # k = N-1/L > 1 AND k is integer ==> is L a factor N-1 i.e. L = (N-1)/k for some k <= K?
        #
        # to apply this in practise: allow up to K=N-1 steps and check factors:
        # N=40 => find all factors of N-1=39 => 39=3*13. This means:
        # 3 steps of length 13 OR 13 steps of length 3 lands exactly on top of last point.

    *Important* Plot window is created as a separate process via multiprocessing so bot stays unresponsive while window

        -Why multiprocessing? Matplotlib has a severe memory leak issue with interractive plots: plots should run in 
        main thread but so does the bot. This creates issue with freeing memory after plot is closed. So far the only 
        solution that works is to create a separate process, with its own memory space and let it finish. This way 
        memory allocation is not saved under main process (the bot) and gets all freed after a window is closed.

    X-axis has round labels that have at least a single command included; empty ones are not included.
    Y-axis has all commands of each round listed from top to bottom.

    Delegates most of the responsibilities to other functions; however, it does perform
        -initial plan file check and reading all lines of code from it,
        -removal of all rows of code that have
            -->comments, or even a single symbol # anywhere
