 'upgrade ...' are for the corresponding upgrade paths.  
 'target change' and 'target reverse' change targeting forward and backward, respectively.                        
 'special 1' and 'special 2' are special ability hotkeys. 
 'sell' for tower selling, 'play' for pressing the play/fast forward button.
