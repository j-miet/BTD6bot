# To have map images displayed in gui instead of ascii:
  1. get images for all maps you need, or just all maps in general
     
      Probably easiest way is to use bloons wiki https://www.bloonswiki.com/List_of_maps_in_BTD6
      and go over any map page, then click the image until it's in fullscreen: this will open clear hud-less image. 
      Then just save as .png. Repeat for all maps.
  2. put all map images inside tools/image_scaler/raw map images AND make sure image names are all in lowercase.
      >examples: in the loop.png, adora's temple.png, #ouch.png
  3. run the script with run.bat file
  4. now you should have properly scaled images with 320x195 res: quite weird res, but fits the current gui nicely.
  5. then just copy these under this folder e.g. btd6bot/Files/map images

# Why are images not included?
  I'd rather not copy and distribute any official game assets. Images would also increase the project size a lot.
